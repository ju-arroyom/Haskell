This repo contains some of the projects I completed during an introductory course in Functional Programming.

The goal of this repository is to show my development and understanding of the functional paradigm through different examples in Haskell.

I am especially proud of the project where [Ibrahim Gabr](https://github.com/igabr/Haskell_Projects) and I coded the game [UNO](https://www.unorules.com/) from scratch. The key component in this project is the intelligent strategy we deployed for the computer's turn to play a card.
