This project required the creation of different modules to handle different stages of the game.

The Helper_Functions module contains all the functions required to manipulate the player's hand and implementing the computer's strategy.

The Game_Logic module contains the chunks of rules necessary for the decision making process for all players.

A detailed description of the intelligent strategy employed can be found in the Strategy.md file.

If you are familiar with Haskell compatible GUIs then you can visualize the whole game in real time!

Enjoy!!!
